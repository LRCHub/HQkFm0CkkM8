# Suchmos – Burn

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I always keeping passion
reckless running highway
Don't make fun I can create the nation
Hey Do again serious talking you
Must make relation I don't need the fashion
You are always front of me
Always standing front of me
You deprive of my freedom
And I have vibration
Positive vibration
You too lose go back in your hole
Beat it now don't need no warfare
Beat it now wasn't born yesterday
First thing first Turn on your feeling
First thing first try a little tenderness
